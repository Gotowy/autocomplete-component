# autocomplete component

The component enables to search, choose and add elements to an uploaded list of elements.

## Built with:

HTML & CSS  
JavaScript  
React (Hooks)

## Functionality:

The component can accept an array of strings or numbers as prop. It allows to choose any number of elements and display them above. Chosen elements can be removed separately or be cleared all at once. Elements can be chosen with keyup/keydown and enter key or with a mouse. Elements are sorted alphabetically and are displayed dynamically while writing down symbols in the search box.

## Status:

For now, the project is completed, but it may get some improvements in the future, though.
